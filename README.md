# Data in Action: Unveiling Real Estate Trends in Singapore with Excel & Data Storytelling

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes the Singapore apartment market from 2015 to 2024, revealing key trends in resale prices and transaction volumes. Using dynamic Excel dashboards and advanced formulas, I uncovered a dramatic price surge starting in 2021, identified shifts in transaction volumes, and highlighted the impact of flat types, storey ranges, and remaining lease years on pricing. The analysis provides actionable insights for real estate investors, policy makers, and potential buyers, offering data-driven guidance for property valuation and investment decisions.

## Business Problem
Singapore's property market exhibits unique characteristics due to limited land availability and high housing demand. For investors and potential buyers, understanding price drivers and market trends is crucial for making informed decisions. However, the complexity of factors affecting property values—including location, property age, and height—makes it challenging to assess fair market value and identify investment opportunities.
This analysis addresses the following key questions:
- What factors most significantly influence property values in Singapore's resale market?
- How have price trends evolved from 2015 to 2024?
- What role do property characteristics like floor height and remaining lease years play in determining value?
- Does proximity to infrastructure impact property prices?

## Methodology
- Data Collection: Compiled a comprehensive dataset of apartment resale records, including variables such as transaction date, flat type, storey range, remaining lease years, and more.
- Data Preparation: Cleaned and structured data using Excel, ensuring consistency across variables.
- Analysis: Utilized Pivot Tables, advanced Excel functions, and dynamic slicers to build interactive dashboards.
- Visualization: Created multiple charts (line, clustered bar, horizontal bar, and pie charts) to illustrate trends and segment the data effectively.

## Skills
- Excel & Advanced Formulas: Pivot Tables, dynamic slicers, conditional formatting, and complex functions.
- Data Visualization: Built interactive dashboards to present data in a clear, actionable format.
- Data Cleaning & Preparation: Ensured high-quality data for analysis, using techniques to manage missing values and anomalies.
- Analytical Thinking: Applied quantitative methods to extract meaningful insights and translate them into business recommendations.

## Results & Business Recommendation
Key Findings:
- Apartment prices remained stable from 2015 to 2020 but surged dramatically starting in 2021.
- Transaction volumes peaked in 2021 and have since declined, though still above pre-2020 levels.
- Larger flats with higher storey ranges and longer lease terms command premium prices.
- Minimal price impact from expressway proximity (86% of properties located 500m+ away)

### Business Recommendations:
1. Investment Strategy:
   - Focus on properties in top-performing towns for maximum value appreciation.
   - Prioritize units on higher floors with longer remaining leases.
   - Consider properties in the 500m+ expressway distance range, as they represent the market majority.
2. Timing Considerations:
   - Monitor market dynamics for potential stabilization in price growth.
   - Track transaction volumes as an indicator of market sentiment.
  
### Next Steps:
- Expand analysis to include demographic data for deeper market understanding.
- Develop predictive models for price trends.
